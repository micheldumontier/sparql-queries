# sparql-queries
A collection of my SPARQL queries

Each SPARQL query is annotated with the [GRLC decorator syntax](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc#decorator-syntax)

You can use the auto-generated [GRLC.io API](http://grlc.io/api-git/micheldumontier/sparql-queries) to try out the queries.

The queries will also eventually be indexed at [Shapes of You](http://index.semanticscience.org/)
